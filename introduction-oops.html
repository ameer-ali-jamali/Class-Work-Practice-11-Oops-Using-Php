        Introduction to OOPS
        OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

        Object-oriented programming is a core of PHP Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes
        and objects that contain both data and functions.


        1 Advantages of OOPS
        2 Programs are faster to execute.
        3 Better code reusability.
        4 Easy to understand code structure.
        5 Very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.
        6 Easy to make fully reusable programs with less code and less development time.

        Disadvantages of OOPS

        1 OOPS cannot be applied everywhere as it is not a universal language.
        2 Need to have a good understanding of classes and objects to apply OOPS.
        3 It takes a lot of effort to create.
        4 It is slower than other programs.
        5 OOPS programs are large in size when compared to normal programs.
